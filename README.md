# CVAE\_pilot\_MD 

The program is designed to run MD simulations that are monitored by CVAE, which would also access 
the MD simulations conditions and decide when to stop or restart an OpenMM simulation. 

For now, there are three case studies were set up: 
1. [Fs-peptide](https://github.com/hengma1001/CVAE_pilot_MD/tree/master/Fs-pep)
2. [P27](https://github.com/hengma1001/CVAE_pilot_MD/tree/master/P27)
3. [ExAB](https://github.com/hengma1001/CVAE_pilot_MD/tree/master/ExAB)
